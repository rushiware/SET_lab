Version control, also known as revision control or source control, refers to a set of processes and tools that enable tracking of multiple versions of software, content, documents, websites, and other information during development. Any system that offers change tracking and control over programming source code and documentation can be considered version control software. The concept of version control has been part of creative processes since the advent of writing.
Software development utilizes the most complex and powerful version control systems. Version control often involves locking files and using a check-out/check-in system for changed versions. Versions can be identified by labels or tags, and approved versions or those that are particularly significant can be designated baselines. Different groups or individuals can work on checked-out versions by branching code from the main trunk. The first person to check in is guaranteed to succeed, but some systems allow for version merging to incorporate further changes into the central repository if other versions are checked out.
Another version control method is branching, where programs in development are copied for development in parallel version, retaining the original and working on the branch or making different changes to each. Each copy is considered a branch, with the original program from which the branch is taken referred to as the trunk, the baseline, the mainline, or the master.
Version control is typically based on a client-server model, but distributed version control is also available. In distributed version control, all copies are in a codebase repository and changes are synchronized through patches or changes shared from peer to peer.
