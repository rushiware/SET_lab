Version control, also known as revision control or source control, refers to a set of processes and tools that enable tracking of multiple versions of software, content, documents, websites, and other information during development. Any system that offers change tracking and control over programming source code and documentation can be considered version control software. The concept of version control has been part of creative processes since the advent of writing.
The purpose of version control is to ensure that content changes during development proceed as planned. Although version control is typically performed by a separate application, it can also be integrated into programs such as integrated development environments (IDEs), word processors, spreadsheets, and collaborative web documents and pages. With version control, servers in multiple locations can run different versions on different sites even as those versions are updated simultaneously.
